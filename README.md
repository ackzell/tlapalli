# tlapalli 

> **[tlah-PAH-lee](https://nahuatl.wired-humanities.org/content/tlapalli)** in Nahuatl means color

A collection of monochromatic dark themes in different hues. Each theme uses lightness and font styles (like _italic_ or **bold**) to distinguish tokens, rather than relying on multiple colors to do the job.

Fun fact: these are all minerals that you can find in Mexico 🤓

# Obsidian
The original idea was to create this theme _only_, which was based on the [Monochrome](https://github.com/anotherglitchinthematrix/monochrome) theme. Though many tweaks have been applied to get it just the way I like them.

# Gold
A kind-of-yellow sort-of-amber like the one I used to work with when I started with computers. Not quite as bright IMO, so gold it is.

# Turquoise
This was the first one I worked on as a variant for Obsidian. I really like having this in the options and will be using it quite often. 

# Quartz
I am not a huge fan of pink, but I was already on a roll  trying with the different variants, so why not having it as well?

# Lapis Lazuli
Not as bright as a sapphire blue, but still nice on *my* eyes.

# Amethyst
Maybe the 3rd or 4th variant I worked on. Lots of purple themes out there, but a monochromatic one?

# Jade
This is a greener hue, closer to those early monitors I aluded to when describing the gold variant. I really like how it looks!

# Fire Opal
This is a tricky one. I am not sure anyone would NOT be thinking "this is screaming errors at me all the time", but I decided to give it a shot. ERRORs are white in this variant, BTW.
